ðŸŒŒ Getting Started with Python for Extragalactic Astronomy
Welcome to this repository, part of my learning journey into observational extragalactic astronomy and Python programming. This tutorial series is designed to build essential Python skills while exploring real astronomical data â€” including tasks such as working with FITS files, WCS coordinate systems, image manipulation and many more.

Whether you're an aspiring astronomer, a passionate stargazer, or just someone fascinated by the universe â€” this is for you!

This study track was recommended by my mentor Lamima Ahad Apu, and the tasks are originally developed by the Mowla Astro Research Group to help beginners get hands-on with real space data.
